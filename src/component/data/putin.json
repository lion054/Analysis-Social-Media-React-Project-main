Among the minority who do pay attention, most blindly believe whatever the talking points are from their chosen political party.  Our political class?  The guiding foreign policy philosophy for both parties is the neo con way.  Both Democrats and Republicans largely believe that America has a kind of &quot;manifest destiny&quot; to dominate the global political and economic sphere.  If the rest of humanity is holding out hope that the American people will somehow wake up or be moved to radically change the current makeup of the DC status quo, don&#39;t hold your breath.  Things will continue as they are up until a major economic collapse of our system.  How long will that be?  I don&#39;t know but things are gradually deteriorating here.  Our culture is post Christian and our economy is based on debt.  I would guess we will have a major collapse in the next ten years, possible less.  I pray God will help us all as we live in evil days.",

    "comment": "If we are to end this conflict, we have to understand the Russian side and prospective.I don&#39;t agree with Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine or its conduct. However, I understand some of their grievances and concerns. Some of them are legitimate, very legitimate. Others are distortions, misinterpretations of history, whether deliberate or not, to justify their heavy-handed response. That is for people to decide.One thing is clear and we cannot ignore (but whichh our Western media and Western governments have chosen to ignore) is one basic fact in all this:We, the West, brokered and entered into two international agreements with Russia and Ukraine. The Minsk Agreements of 2014 and 2015, which tried to resolved the issues between Russia and Ukraine peacefully, to avoid escalation towards a full conflict. Those two international agreements brokered by the West and sanctioned by the UN legally established the status of Crimea as being part of the Russian Federation. They acknowledged the referendum outcome held in Crimea (by a vast majority ethnic Russian population - over 85%) as desiring to be Russian Federation citizens. The West and Ukraine, agreed to respect that position. Meaning Crimea was officially recognized as Russian Federation sovereign territory and its citizenship became Russians, by their own choice. The second part of the Minsk Agreements addressed the issue of the Russian-Ukranian problems in Dombas, particularly opposition to Ukraine&#39;s government and movement of Russian separatists, by ethnic Russians in the Dombas region. Which led to fighting up to and before 2014 by militias on both sides. And some nationalistic militias acting independently of Ukraine that carried out attacks in the three regions where Russian ethnic people live and wanted to be part of the Russian Federation or at least have some autonomony in their governance. Those people were attacked and repressed. Ukraine government was unable to control those militias or unwilling to (there&#39;s a Vice documentary speaking those militias leaders on YouTube anyone can see, who state openly they don&#39;t take orders from Ukraine military, they refuse to and will never lay down their weapons, despite the Minsk Agreements). So Russia intervened in a limited way in Dombas. The Minsk Agreements of 2014 and 2015 tried to address the Dombas regional conflicts, by demilitarising the area, and following a diplomatic and democratic approach. However due to the continued militias fighting and a failure for the diplomatic outcome in Dombas, the agreement did not work. The militias resumed fighting, and Russia decided to intervene directly, after appeals to the international community were ignored.This is how the Special Military Operation started from the Russian prospective. Now Ukraine is saying Crimea is part of Ukraine, which is in direct violation of the international Minsk Agreements. And the West is doing nothing about that (despite co-signing those agreements and recognizing Crimea as being part of the Russian Federation).  In fact, the West has chosen to arm and give Ukraine the means to attack Crimea, without any constraint or conditions. How is Russia to perceive the actions of the West? Untrustworthy, dishonest and disregarding of Russia&#39;s sovereign interritory and security. The conclusion Russia now has reached, is that the West is at war with Russia and Russia must defend itself.",

That&#39;s why the war in Ukraine.",

It&#39;s not neither he nor she and Hinduism has had such a neuter term for it for gazillion years: &#39;Brahman&#39;. If anything it&#39;s a progressive idea for the west. Also speaking on what the scripture says, he&#39;s a political leader not a preacher. And the irony of it is Russia used to be against the church in the days of Stalin and now his successor is all for it it seems. Of course he knows that&#39;s an easy way to manipulate people.",

Russia should have bomb all road and railroad entrances in Ukraine and call for talks. If no response, bomb all power and gas distribution points, leave Ukraine in dark and no gas or fuel. Call for talks. If no response, continue with precision bombing destroying all life support infrastructure, leaving just a way to Russia to move in and help after agreement with Ukraine leaders. This way, no dead Russian soldiers or Ukraine soldiers, no dead civilians ,no weapons moved to Ukraine no war.Edit...i forgot to to ad something. Why Russia didn&#39;t respond to Nord Stream attacks? They should have destroyed marine internet cables to Europe in such manner to need years to rebuild those cables",

It&#39;s difficult for them to believe anything else whilst he&#39;s poisoning their minds. Just remember this guy is flattening ukraine for wanting to be an independent civilised nation. He makes it a Russia v the west argument or visa versa. He knows the west wouldn&#39;t attack Russia, but as an  aggressor, he wants his people to believe that the west supporting ukraine to stop them being wiped off the earth, started the war so when he escalates it further the people don&#39;t turn against him. The guy does not live in the real world and is still living in history feeling aggrevieved for everything and anything that has happened in Russian history. Everyone,even his own people know he wants a return to the soviet union made up of countries that Russia conquered and took there freedom to live under a pre historic Russian rule. Why doesn&#39;t he just ask the countries if they want to do it instead of conquering them. He just doesn&#39;t get that they are independent and don&#39;t want to be part of Russia. In the same way Russia doesn&#39;t want to be part of China.",

It\u2019s the ultimate disrespect for the sovereignty and self-determination of the Ukrainian people, who have been trying to assert their independence for decades. He calls Euromaidan a western backed coup. But it was a revolution of the people. Talks for European/Ukrainian alliance started in 2012, but were suspended by  president Yanukovych in favor of closer ties with Russia. People took to the streets in numbers too large to jail or kill and eventually Yanukovych  had to slink back to daddy Putin.Yanukovych Was a Russian stooge and insanely corrupt. He stole billions. People found his opulent mansion with 37 cars, a golf course, bowling alley, a yacht, a zoo, and a helicopter. Documents in the house showed that he paid 42 million for chandelier crystals alone.West was verbally supportive of Ukraine, but did not \u201cfund\u201d it as Putin says. There was nothing to fund\u2014it was literally just hundreds of thousands of people in the streets.Baltic states have joined  NATO because they are afraid of Putin. He wants to reincorporate all former USSR nations. Already has puppet leaders in Chechnya, Belarus, Kazakstan and he\u2019s trying in Syria. He wants to be Peter the Great with a massive empire, but instead he\u2019s a short, nasty reptile who bombs schools and hospitals when he loses in  battle.",

I don&#39;t have a dog in the Russian conflict, but I am so disgusted with the immoral, irreligious Western leaders. Even the Vatican is invested in big pharma&#39;s trans hormone replacement drugs and trans surgeries mass media marketing campaign, to profit from warping the lives, and destroying the health of young people. Any country that can avoid malinvestment on a moving forward basis will have the economic power in the future. Without economic power, there&#39;s no military power.",

Giving his people incentive to invest in domestic production and using taxes to improve military and infrastructure and hence creating new jobs. It&#39;s much of what trump wanted for us here. Wish we would have done that and much of our cost wouldn&#39;t have went up in the USA. I&#39;m not happy with a war but he seems like a good leader minus that and I can see why he feels it was brought to his door. He also isn&#39;t lying about our own leadership telling us false things so I&#39;m very happy to have been able to listen to him and judge for myself.",

    "comment": "Russia has been dying for many years - corruption, aging population, the young leaving Russia.  The solution to this demise was expansion as the only option, so we then had \u201cRusskiy mir\u201d \u2014 or \u201cRussian world.\u201d It is a concept that predates Putin\u2019s rise to power. But one Putin has aggressively embraced it and made his own. Among other things, it means that when Putin says \u201cRussia,\u201d he does not mean a state called the Russian Federation within its current boundaries. He means a Russia which has no borders; any place where Russians live, where the Russian language is spoken \u2014 even by a small minority, any place where the influence of Russia or Russians has been felt.  Putin has been trying to create a new world order, where Russia is feared, respected and still played a leading role in the world (not 3rd place behind China) through nationalism, imperial ambitions, unquestioned obedience to the leader, a chosen nation (now I&#39;ve heard that statement before worryingly) and chasing a great cause more important than personal goals.  What we are seeing now is the result of this great experiment that has been forming for many years, but not taken seriously by the West. When a nation thinks itself of higher moral principles, broader soul and generous in spirit, yet commits war crimes against humanity and goes against all international rules and order - Houston, we have another problem!",

It allows Turkey to govern which vessels can go through in times of WAR which is of particular importance as Turkey is also a NATO MEMBERWhich is problematic as if they were to close the straits Russia would have to perceive it as a Blockade which is a Act of War which could escalate into a article 5 if Russia attacked the Turkish Navy which is what happened at the Battle of Sinope the act which launched the Crimean War of 1847 which lead to Turkey ,France and the United Kingdom  occupying Stevastopol  and destroying The Black Sea Fleet",

    "comment": "The Russians had no clue how to set up a capitalistic model. The Russian Mafia, who had always been capitalistic during Soviet Times actually led them into capitalism. However the Ethics of the Oligarchs, many who were Russian MaFia, led to the wonderful economic model these people suffer from. Sadly, Russians are liars and thieves. After 70 years of their Socialist Communism experiment, they all learned to lie in order to survive.",

    "comment": "I thought Putin had a few yachts of his own??? A lot of his ideas for his economy are going to be very popular with Russians . But it sounds like \u201c we can\u2019t get tech goods delivered anymore we\u2019re have to rely on ourselves! We have to grow more food ourselves! We need to make more arms and ammunition\u2019s! We need to find someone els to buy Russian gas . Sorry we let all the other Russians steel thre wealth!  I can\u2019t help wondering what would happen if Putin was no longer in power ? Anyway I thought we was all getting along fine until Ukrain. His acting like it\u2019s going to be a long (WAR ) Putin needs to go and Russia needs to pull out of Ukrain and try and mend what been broken before we end up with world war 3",

Putin&#39;s speech is &quot;depressing&quot; in the sense of the conflicting powers, USA and Russia, are apparently ready to go on wrecking human civilization for &quot;some time to come,&quot; or is it &quot;to kingdom come&quot;? I am getting SCREWED out of a &quot;peaceful existence&quot; with 8 billion people, with whom I am willing to &quot;try getting along,&quot; if they can try to get along with me. The Golden Rule of Humans needs to be recognized and DEMANDED from demented leaders - OR ELSE!!!!!!! People must rise against idiotic aggression by &quot;national nitwits&quot; and corporate rapists reaping profits from war!!!!! Media that supports any war effort needs to be &quot;assaulted&quot; for denying human rights to 8 billion people NOT to be made victims of a bullshit war!!!!!!",

We will not be the first to do this;\r\r- to immediately begin construction of housing for defense industry employees and launch a program of preferential rent at a rate below the market;\r\r- it is necessary to remove any interdepartmental formalities, omissions and other nonsense in order to develop the economy, it is also necessary to create additional conditions for citizens to invest money, earning money within the country, while it is important to protect these investments;\r\r- to continue the development of regional projects, including the construction of roads, highways, free gasification and the development of trade routes;\r\r\u2014 to reform the system of higher education.",

However... I can&#39;t help but notice the exaggerated distance between the speaker and the applauders! It&#39;s just not a meeting with Macron!

Political norms have eroded to the point that our Government looks like a kangaroo court. Mass shootings are out of control. Tribalism and intollerance of diversity is killing the soul of our Nation. We are self destructing and the whole World is watching it with disgust. We are becoming less and less trust worthy to other countries both our examples of Domestic insecurity and financial instability. Other countries are becoming less and less willing to use the US dollar for the entire International system. We are really effing up and we need to wake up and stop the infighting and concentrate on re-evaluating what it means to be an American regardless of what culture, origin, skin color, sexual orientation, religion and whatever else creates divisions and fractures our society. We need to stop misinformation campaigns against the citizens of our country. We need to outlaw Neo Natzi ism and stop hate speech which is root cause of all these mass shootings. There is so much more but most importantly if we don&#39;t change our image and improve societal relations within this country, the United States will not exist for very much longer.",

Most of this speech is plain waffling and directionlessuntil he is drawn back to &quot;west hate&quot; and the Ukraine War, started by everyone else except him.The Zombified crowd look like they need a break from their brainwashing.",

Just a bunch of big words that had no meaning nor just behind it, a weak minded soul he is after the defeat of hundreds of thousands of his citizen.

It was like a communist rally with Starlin talking to his subjects with no emotions and to scared not to clap when demanded. The Iron curtain is closing for all of them and the discussed and fear in their eyes",

The majority of Russians (esp. in and around the federal cities) are just like cult followers who can only go rotten and perish with their \u201cultimate\u201d cult leader, RottenSia&#39;s PooTin. There\u2019s no way to make cult followers see the reality.  But reality bites \u2026 real hard.  RuZzia will soon be reverted to a destitution just like the one that followed the collapse of the USSR.",

    "comment": "So in summary, this speech is to gain more investment to be put into more military aid for Russia,Funding for Education &amp; Training in Science &amp; Technology, in secondary schools, colleges, universities &amp; training centres,Better Education for young Scientists, for producing Chemical &amp; Nuclear weapons,Better Education for young Technicians, for producing better military technology and equipment,Cheaper rent for employees to work in military facilities and bases,Pleading for Russian Citizens to return back to Russia to help pay taxes to support their projects for their latest programs and to be used as a work force to ether work in military facilities to ramp up production or replace the amount of troops that have been lost on the frontline,Pleading with Western Businesses to return and set up businesses in Russia, to pay business tax for these projects,To try and brainwash Russian Citizens into supporting this war in Russia, as a way of showing them his superiority &amp; power,That Russia is doing much better without the help from other countries and what he is doing is for them and the protection of Russia,But in reality it is just a ploy to keep him in his safe cosy bunker, as he is in fear of being assassinated,This is not to benefit the Citizens of Russia, it is to protect himself against all the war crimes that he has committed during his time in power,One thing he certainly won\u2019t mention in this speech is the fraud that himself, his family and his higher inner circle is committing, by pilfering money for their own wealth, from funds that are set up to help the Russian Citizens,Funds that are meant to be for better Education, Health Care, Transportation and Energy, (better Power lines, Gas pipelines &amp; Water supply to Eastern Russia), where only a small percentage actually goes towards building better infrastructure health care and education,He also doesn\u2019t mention the higher percentage the elite members of the government, (Putin\u2019s inner circle), plus himself, taking the highest percentage, are taking from these funds for themselves,Which is one of the reasons why they have all been sanctioned, and their assets, Luxuries including Mansions, Yachts, etc\u2026 plus their money in foreign bank accounts have been taken away and seized,All the money in foreign savings accounts, that has paid for these luxuries that had been stolen from Russian taxpayers, that could be sold off to other Russian Orcs for money to pay for, or produce better military equipment, artillery and supplies for his war in Ukraine, then bought back at a later date,Yes the Donbas and Luhansk may of claimed Independence from Ukraine, before Russia annexed them and claims that they are now part of Russia, although Russia only has control of half of them,But Ukraine also recognise these two Territories and although they are independent, they are still regarded as being part of Ukraine,But Lviv Oblast, Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Kharkiv Oblast, Ternopil Oblast, Volyn Oblast, Zakarpattia Oblast, Zeporizhzhia Oblast, Chernihiv Oblast, Kharkiv, Kyiv Oblast, Summy Oblast, Poltava Oblast, Kherson Oblast, Odesa Oblast, Odessa, Cherkasy Oblast, Rivne Oblast, Khmelnytskyi Oblast, Kirovohrad Oblast, Vinnytsia Oblast, Mykolaiv Oblast, have not claimed independence from Ukraine, therefore Russia\u2019s attempt to invade and annex, in the purpose of Russify these territories, is an act of war upon these Ukrainian Territories, therefore they are all classed as war crimes, Russia had no right to invade or be there in the first place,        \ud83d\ude0c   \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6Slava Ukrainii",

    "comment": "Those who support fair peace demand: The regulations of the UN Security Council and its quorum can and must be urgently adapted to current global needs! Abolish the veto right for all cross-border aggressors and lower the yes-quorum for sending a peacekeeping mission to a 2/3 majority. Not only UN Security Council states already have armies that could be deployed as part of a short-term UN-coordinated task force for fair referendums (plebiscites) in disputed crisis areas such like: Kurdistan (Northern Syria, Western Iran), DR Congo, Eastern Ukraine, Jammu and Kashmir, Nagorno-Karabakh (Central Armenia &amp; Azerbaijan), Western China (Tibet and Xinjiang), Palestine, Southern Morocco (Western Sahara)...In addition to a choice between two or more competing states, fair referendums in a disputed region must, of course, also offer the possibility of fully self-determined sovereignty. (A state transition such as that from Yugoslavia to Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia.... - or from Czechoslovakia to the Czech Republic and Slovakia). Do we only admire those &quot;representatives of the people&quot; whose administration favors bloody conflicts? As soon as people again honor good proposals of individuals for fair settlement of disputes (and compare, discuss and select corresponding improved regulations), we will be able to climb the next rung on the evolutionary ladder.",
