I know that because my grandparents were his parents age my mother is his age His children are my age . It is a different world how we grew up how my Parents, grandparents grew up!  Is our society any better than when they were growing up they were able to afford a home my grandmother didn&#39;t have to work. Does every era have its difficulties of course it does.  This man does not live in the realities of today does he believe that his leadership has made the lives of children better or anybody who&#39;s hard working American better under his Leadership? And while he tries to navigate this world from his world to be relevant. He is failing miserably. And that is because he is jaded by money and power and as my husband says absolute power corrupts absolutely and that&#39;s what has happened over the years of him being in power. He cannot grasp in his mind the reality that he is destroying this country and its people and he will go down in my book and many others as the worst president we have ever had in modern times. And those are the facts and I sure would not as a human being want to go down in history like that. Sadly his only goal is to be president so behind the scenes do you think for real that he is running anything in this country other than the fact hes just a figure head and not even a good one at that?  The true arrogance of him believing that he has made the country better by his poor leadership and poor policies is just deplorable. When he took office things were starting to look up finally coming out of a pandemic and then everything by the stroke of the pin went down the toilet and he doesn&#39;t want to take any responsibility for that. We are not better off in this country after 2 years Of this failed leadership we are drowning in their poor policies. And frankly I don&#39;t think he cares or even really knows the destruction he has caused or his people have costs that are controlling this. And why is this happening because he is not in his right mind. That is the simple fact because you watch it every time he opens his mouth every time hes on the stage He struggles to know where he is and what he is doing at any time. You know there&#39;s so many people that say oh that poor man I don&#39;t feel sorry for him he knows exactly what he wanted he knows exactly How he is not affected by anything that he does and he lives in his own oblivion. He no more cares than that fly he compares him self to!!!",

They used to be real reporters real interviewers but even when he is asking these questions and getting the answers hes not counter asking those questions enough because there&#39;s so many lies and innuendoes and it&#39;s an innuendos and untruth in what president Biden is saying. You see I keep reminding people The rich elite and powerful they don&#39;t live in the same world that we do they do not suffer the policies did they pass on the American people. Does Joe Biden go pump his own gas no does he buy his own food no in fact they have caretakers for them that do everything for them. He has had that elite status for over 50 years. These elites have forgotten the human condition. It&#39;s almost like becoming a child again They don&#39;t do anything to take care of themselves and they like it that way. Do not want to live in the world we live out in fact when all is said and done they will leave and go to their mansions be protected the rest of their lives with people taking care of their needs.",

Again the government does not create jobs and losses within the government. It&#39;s all important chip act that they pass does that mean that it would be made here that companies would grow an industry here no it could be done overseas like so many of our companies have left because of the high taxes to do business in the US.

Millions of jobs were layed off and about the time he goes to office it just so happens to be that the coronavirus was easing up. So it only makes sense that of course when you allow people to go back to work that a huge spike of millions of jobs will be back. He didn\u2019t create the jobs, he literally gave the jobs basically back. Right? If I tell you that your fired then a few days later tell you your hired again, did I create that job or\u2026.obviously this is just 1 issue on a lot of things he said that was a little misleading but I\u2019m not going to write a book here.",

I&#39;ll tell you. They are not in the oval office, because we, the people, haven&#39;t put them there. Instead, we have decided to go along with this ridiculous circus of a dividing popularity contest that has been created not by us but by those really in power, those who controll your thoughts without your awareness through the ideas they feed you from your favorite methods of ingestion.... msnbc... fox... cnn...

    "comment": "Regardless of My overall differences of political ideology with Joe Biden (I&#39;m not a fan of Trump though by the way, no defense to anyone who does support him,  I&#39;m not mad at you). I nonetheless do not wish failure for our President regardless of party and I certainly want my country to succeed and realize what I think is an overall shared goal of restoring the US back to its #1 spot in the world economy. You know, back where we are a first world first class respected  leader. Now all that idealistic rhetoric aside; it sounds good, but I think President Biden is painting the picture a little prettier than it actually is in reality. We still have a tremendous wealth Gap between the poor and the top 1%. The middle class is still largely decimated where that should be the one sector of the economy that is the largest, the backbone of the nation as we used to say. Inflation I think is worse than they&#39;re letting on. It doesn&#39;t take an economics PHd to figure that out, all you have to do is go to the local Safeway and see cheese go up another $3 a pound. These mandates like here in California that in 10 years everyone has to buy an electric vehicle to combat climate change: well we don&#39;t have the infrastructure set up for that. I can go to a local gas station on any corner and get gas and be out and done in 15 minutes max. As I understand it, it takes hours to charge an electric vehicle that only goes a roughly 200, 250 mie span before it needs to be charged back up. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s realistic. Perhaps he did create 10 million new jobs but I really can&#39;t see where that&#39;s true considering so many people have pretty much dropped out of the workforce with that quiet quitting.  And as far as the COVID Pandemic being over, I read something I think it was in The Washington Post a few weeks ago that said that there was a new severe variant of COVID that was hitting just in time for the fall. So I don&#39;t know how he can be having a party celebrating so-called achievements when I think most people would agree that we&#39;re still very much in the soup. Especially considering  interest rates are higher than they&#39;ve been in 20 plus years, inflation at a 40-year high. Here in California it&#39;s like $6 a gallon for gas. The level of homelessness is I am pretty sure IS at an absolute all-time high against any other time in history. So I have to ask a question: how can he rightfully say that we&#39;re on a good path and that things are improving? The stock market is more erratic than ever and I think there are a lot of bubbles building economically not only in the housing market but in the equities market too. Plus constant supply chain issues for everything! I just don&#39;t know where Joe Biden is getting his optimism. I HOPE I&#39;m wrong and he&#39;s right. But I just can&#39;t see it. I do feel however that perhaps with him advanced age, it would be good if the Democratic party nominated someone significantly younger, more informed with dynamic ideas and energy - -and that&#39;s not AOC or any of the squad, and no disrespect but it&#39;s NOT Kamala Harris either. I favor Andrew Yang or even Bernie Sanders or Liz Warren. Though older, they have some really fundamentally logical ideas that could be very beneficial for the countr. It&#39;s time for new blood if the executive branch level. Okay, I&#39;m going to get off my soapbox now. I just say God help us all!",

They would&#39;ve clearly said what they would&#39;ve done to inflict fear and make sure that nukes are not used. But the truth is that if Putin uses nukes in Ukraine, he is showing that he is brave enough and fully capable of using nuke and that would scare the sense out of US government and people. And european leaders and people even more so. But they are putting up a facade of &quot;catastrophic consequences&quot; to stop him. The only thing you can do after Putin goes nukes is watch the gas cloud and parades in Kremlin.",

It&#39;s crazy how presidents do nothing for our country but when it comes close to voting they are just all throwing bull around to get our votes. What&#39;s so sick is he&#39;s always bringing up his family to make us teary eyed. It&#39;s horrible what happened to his family but just sick to use them to get our votes. He&#39;s made so many mistakes since running for president that nothing will change what he does now to get the American people to vote for him. I promise you if he&#39;s ever president we will be back to the problems just like what we have now with the borders and running through our retirement because he has done nothing about inflation and now we&#39;re paying high prices for food and it&#39;s only going to get worse. Why not have the FDA control the shinkage of bags of frozen foods to the bread that has gotten smaller and  the prices are the same. We went from 16 oz to 9 oz on frozen vegetables and paying more. How in the name of God can families live like this and our presidents have done nothing about it. Thank heaven I only have myself to take care of because I&#39;m barely getting by.  All Biden is good for is talking crap and giving us crap.",

HR departments of majority corporates are run by Indians and their is systematic pattern of hiring. You can find people from all over the world in corporate offices now days on h1 and other types of visa. To make things worse current presidency agressively slowed down stock market where millions of new retail investors mostly young people found new career during pandemic. Its like president office asking young people to go out and fill gas on pumping stations and sell tabbaco because that what they are destine for.",

I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.I&#39;m astounded as to why no presidents want to print Treasury backed greenbacks then again they may be afraid because the fact is just six months after JFK singed eo 00001 which granted the issue of money to the Treasury to which it truly belongs he was dead I don&#39;t know how long after Lincoln issued Treasury notes he was dead but the comparison is there.",

    "comment": "The absolute saddest part is all of our churches have been running non stop helping low income black Americans because they don\u2019t have enough money for anything. And unfortunately this happens everytime a democrat or a globalist takes office. They intentionally do it to destroy the black community along with target abortion and welfare to destroy self worth. I just wish all the liberals would come out and go threw the projects with us and see the pain and suffering they have caused. This summer we found multiple low income families with no electricity in 115* heat. Luckily conservatives have rounded up Churches to help us get there power back on. But I\u2019ve had so many black mothers cry on my shoulder the last 7-8 months where it\u2019s keeping me up at night seeing the pain they are going threw. Biden has a huge collection of videos of him saying racist things and voting for racist policies so when you see him take office and deliberately cause inflation just like Obama and bushes did. It\u2019s perfectly clear he intentionally wants to inflict pain on low income or primarily black Americans.",

    "comment": "Btw people the news wouldn\u2019t write negative stories about Reagan or George w Bush. That us until they do they typical switch. But Reagan was protected by a lot of media that\u2019s why people don\u2019t know the truth about Nicaragua and how wrong it was. George w Bush was protected and allowed to start iraq war 2003. But without biden iraq never would\u2019ve happened. Biden is who pushed it threw the senate. \u2014 and biden is directly responsible for leading the Ukraine people along and provoking Russia to attack. I can\u2019t believe people haven\u2019t been paying attention the last 8 yrs everyone has been warning. Russia will attack if we keep dabbling in Ukraine. But the media is protecting him. Now here\u2019s how you know when running propaganda the media will repeat over and over the one thing that\u2019s not true. Reporting on Ukraine it all went like \u201cUnprovoked attack! Unprovoked! Unprovoked!\u201d Uhh anyone with half a brain knows that\u2019s a lie because multiple professors have did talks. Talking about how eventually Russia will be provoked if it appears we are trying to make Ukraine a nato country. Wel Ukraine went out saying they wanna join nato and that\u2019s when I knew they would be crushed because Russia warned us multiple times the last 10yrs Ukraine is a nonnegotiable just like the USA during the Cuban missile crisis. We\u2019ve attacked people for a lot less so we are the last people to be judging.",

Over here our boarders also aren\u2019t  very Secure as they should be either every day of the week we have people crossing the channel people who we have no room for over here costing the government (or rather tax payers) to foot the bill for putting them up in hotels. In October our gas and electric and water bills are going up even more so than they are now. so people are worried about keeping warm this winter and being able to afford food, the government is helping with some of that but I fear that it may not help everyone.also just like the U.S when Russia invaded Ukraine Our fuel prices went up drastically too making it harder for people to be able to afford to run a car at the moment let alone pay for tax for some vehicle owners. Basically we are all going to feel the grip of these sanctions just as Russia \ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa is now and it\u2019s going to be hard for us all from now on and I\u2019m glad that NATO and the EU governments are working together to help the Ukrainians and each other make the world habitable for generations to come buy changing how certain things are done only by helping each other and keeping calm and carrying on can we get threw this together.",
